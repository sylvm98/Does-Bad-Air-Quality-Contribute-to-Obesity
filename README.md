Data sources:

Both air pollution and obesity data are pubic.
The county-level annual mean particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) dataset is derived from the Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group at Dalhousie University.
The individual-level data on obesity is from the 2008 Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS), which is publicly available on China National Survey Data Archive (CNSDA).

Data matching, Analysis and Modelling process in STATA:

The scripts used for,
1. Data Processing: matching county-level data to individual-level data;
2. Modelling Processing: OLS, RDD, 2SLS;
3. Robust Checks, Certain Graphics and Visualization;
are in .do format and can be run using STATA.
